# Zelle-Python-Solutions

When learning Python, I found the book, **"Python Programming An Introduction to Computer Science"** to be the best book for self-study. However, during self-study I could not find solutions to Programming Questions. Therefore, I decided to include **solutions** to some of **Programming Questions**. 

I must add that the solutions to the Zelle's programming questions are my own. They are to be used only as a guide. Though they should be correct, *I assume no responsibility on the correctness of the problems*. I am open to suggestions to improve a solution or point to me if a solution is incorrect.
